ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips for Event Handling

Always check if event object exists before using it
Use event delegation for dynamically added elements
Remove event listeners when elements are destroyed
Use once: true option for one-time events
Consider performance with high-frequency events (scroll, mousemove)
Handle accessibility with keyboard navigation
Test on different devices for touch events
Use preventDefault() carefully - understand what it blocks
